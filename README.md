All data and tricks, I tried to build an Eurorack Modular Synth

You could find here all my Research, work, experiment, read on how to build an Eurorack Modular Synth

1 - Case

Build a wood case and add racks to screw the modules.

2 - Power supply

Build a power supply. !!! attention - High voltage 220V !!!

It's although possible to buy one if you're not confident enough for building it. 

Build or buy bus board for plugging modules.

Build power cable for your modules. 

3 - Electronic and Pcb

To build your PCB, you need the schematics and how to use kicad software.

But, you can although find some pcb read to buy or ready to etch (GERBER files)

4 - Front panel

To build a front panel (Have a look at front panel directorie) you need : Inkscape software, a laserCutter (to build with wood or pmma) or a PCB supplyer to etch it in PCB material.

5 - Knob

To have a 3d knob (Have a look at front panel directorie) you need : Freecad software and a 3D printer
