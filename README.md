All data to build an Eurorack Modular Synth

You could find here all my work on how to build an Eurorack Modular Synth

1 - Case

Build a wood case and add racks to screw the modules.

2 - Power supply

Build a power supply. It's although possible to buy one if you're not confident enough for building it.

Build or buy bus board for plugging modules.
Build power cable for your modules. 

3 - Electronic and Pcb

To build your PCB, you need the schematics and how to use kicad.

But, you can although find some pcb ready to buy or ready to etch (GERBER files)

4 - Front panel

To build a front panel you need : Inkscape software, a laserCutter (to build with wood or pmma) or a PCB supplyer to etch it in PCB material.

5 - Knob

To have a 3d knob you need : Freecad software and a 3D printer
